# Python Assignment Template

## This is where you will submit a python assignment.

1. You are required to commit and push your changes to your repository at the *end of every class that you work on your assignment* with your current code **even if you have not completed it**
2. If you have additional resources such as images, organize them into folders.
3. Feedback and grades for this assignment will be provided via pull request to this assignment.

If working on the problems using repl with GitHub intergration, make sure to set your .replit file to run the practice file you want. For example, here's a file called `assignment.py` that will run from the root folder:

```
language="python3"
run="python 'assignment.py'"
```
